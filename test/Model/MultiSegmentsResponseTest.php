 * <p>Experian's Business Information Services is a leader in providing data and predictive insights to organizations, helping them mitigate risk and improve profitability.  The Businesses API provides integrated access to our business database which provides comprehensive, third-party-verified information on 99.9 percent of all U.S. companies, with the industry's most extensive data on the broad spectrum of small and midsize businesses.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The Businesses API provides a la carte access to Experian's commercial credit and  commercial public record information, including commercial scores, trades, corporate linkage, bankruptcies, liens, judgments, and more.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>It All Starts With a Search</strong></p> <p>The Business Search API allows you to input a business name, address, city, and state to find their Business Identification Number (BIN) - you'll need this to get data from most of the other APIs.
